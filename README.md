# ReSieve - A Safer Community Forum
### Filtering Content, Bettering Lives

Final Project, CS-GY 9223 Cloud Computing, Spring 2022 (Prof. Sambit Sahu)

## Motivation

We use Internet Forums and Social Media everyday. With its ever-increasing exposure to kids and young adults has made it disturbingly easy to be subjected to textual abuse through messaging platforms. We aim to develop a solution that acts as an effective filter for moderating toxic image and text posts. The project idea is to mimic some primitive features like post, search and upvote present on social media platforms by effectively using AWS components. Additionally, to develop a ML model for Filtering Offensive Text Posts.
